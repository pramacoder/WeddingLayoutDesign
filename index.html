            Once Upon a Time in College...<br>
            William Saputra and Skyee Kanahaya were just two ordinary classmates at university, each lost in their own
            world of books, assignments, and dreams. But little did they know, fate had a different story in store for
            them. It all started in a crowded lecture hall where their eyes met for the first time. <br>
            Skyee, with her radiant smile and easy laugh, caught William’s attention immediately. He couldn’t quite
            explain it, but there was something magnetic about her. But as the days went by, they became mere
            acquaintances, sharing notes and exchanging casual conversations about class topics. Despite their friendly
            exchanges, there was something unspoken between them, a growing connection that neither of them dared to
            address.
